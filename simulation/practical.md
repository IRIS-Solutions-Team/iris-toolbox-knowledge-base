## Practical problems operating (larger) nonlinear models

* Difficult to tell if the problem is imperfection of the numerical algorithm, or
  the simulation reaching out of the corridor of stability

* Use auxiliary devices to make convergence happen, and to measure the
  extent of the pressures

---

## False slope 

* Occasionally binding constraints

* Discontinuities pose relatively little difficulties

* The zero slope of the `max` or `min` functions is a more serious problem

## Pressure relief valves (PRVs)

* Mechanical

* Structural
